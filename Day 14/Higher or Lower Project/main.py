# choose 2 entries from the dictionary and save to vars profile_a and profile_b
#create game over variable set to False. Turn this to true once player gets answer wrong
#create score variable that changes with each correct guess until game over
#in a while loop check for game over if game not over AKA player has not gotten answer wrong:
    #print description about each profile with VS art in between
    #ask player to choose one
    #if correct, profile b becomes profile a and we get a new random profile from gamedata
    # add one to score and display score
    #if wrong answer, display score
